lindemann is a python package to calculate the Lindemann index  of a lammps trajectory as well as the progression of the Lindemann index per frame of temperature ramps  for phase transition analysis.

## Background

A key problem with the measurement of the melting point of nanoparticles, as laid
out by Alavi [56], is that with decreasing size of a given nanoparticle the phase
transition, defined as the temperature of a sudden change in the enthalpy, becomes
less pronounced. This is caused by the surface effect: for a given cluster the surface
area is larger compared to a bulk structure of the same size. Melting does not take
place all at once, but is a longer melt transition and no longer really a melting point.
[57]
The Lindemann index, stated in equation 2.30 presents a solution for this prob-
lem. It describes the root-mean-square (rms) fluctuation of the bonds or interatomic
distance in the system over time (or temperature, if the temperature of the sys-
tem changes as the simulation progresses). The Lindemann index is a more robust
method to determine the melting point of nanoparticles, opposed to the enthalpy.
Accordingly the Lindemann index is often considered, when the melting point of
nano-particles is of interest. [56â€“58] The index is defined as, [59]

## Installation

```bash
pip install lindemann
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add lindemann
```

## Usage

```console
$ lindemann [OPTIONS] TRJFILE
```
or if installed with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run [OPTIONS] TRJFILE
```
**Options**:

* `-t`: Calculates the Lindemann-Index for the Trajectory file
* `-f`: Calculates the Lindemann-Index for each frame.
* `-a`: Calculates the Lindemann-Index for each atom for each frame.
* `-p`: Returns a plot Lindemann-Index vs. Frame.
* `-l`: Saves the individual Lindemann-Index of each Atom in a lammpstrj, so it can be viewed in Ovito.
* `-v, --version`: Prints the version of the lindemann package.
* `-ti, -timeit`: Uses timeit module to show running time
* `--help`: Show this message and exit.
